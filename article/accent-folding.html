<h1>Accent Folding</h1>

<p>Another generation of technology has passed and Unicode is almost everywhere. The next step is to write software that is not just "internationalized" but truly multilingual. In this article we will lay out some history and theory, then walk through a neat hack called accent folding. Accent folding has its limitations but it can help make some important but overlooked user interactions work better.</p>

<p>
  A common assumption about i18n is that every user fits into a single locale like "English, United States" or "French, France". It's a hangover from the PC days when just getting the computer to display the right squiggly bits was a big deal. One byte equaled one character, no exceptions, and you could only load one language's alphabet at a time. This was fine because it was better than nothing, and because users spent most of their time with documents they or their coworkers produced themselves.
</p>

<p>
  Today users deal with data from everywhere, in multiple languages and locales, all the time and all mixed up together. The locale I <i>prefer</i> is only loosely correlated with the locales I <i>expect applications to process</i>.</p>

<p>
  Consider this address book:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Fulanito López
  </li>
  <li>
    Erik Lørgensen
  </li>
  <li>
    Lorena Smith
  </li>
  <li>
    James Lö
  </li>
</ul>

<div style=" FLOAT:right; MARGIN-RIGHT:5px; MARGIN-LEFT:5px">
  
<div id="jk:2" style="TEXT-ALIGN:left">
    <img id="pb2h" src="entourage.png" style="WIDTH:318px; HEIGHT:72px;BORDER:solid 1px #999">
  </div>
  
<div style=" TEXT-ALIGN:center">
    <i>Fig. 0: Hey Entourage, where are my contacts?</i>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  If I compose a new message and type "lo" in the To: field, what do you think happens? In many applications only Lorena Smith will show up. They "support Unicode", in the sense that they don't corrupt or barf on it, but that's it.
</p>

<p>
  This problem is not just in address books. Think about inboxes, social bookmarks, comment feeds, users who speak multiple languages, users in internet cafés in foreign countries, even URLs. Look at the journalist Ryszard Kapuściński and how different websites handle his name:

<p>There is no excuse for your software to play dumb when the user types "<b>cafe</b>" instead of "<b>café</b>".</p>

<h4>Áçčềñṭ Ḟøłɖǐṅg</h4>

    <div id="jk:4" style="TEXT-ALIGN:left">

In specific applications of search that favor recall over precision, like our address book example, <b>á</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>å</b>, and <b>â</b> can be treated as semantically equivalent. Accents (aka diacritical marks) are by and large pronunciation hints that don't affect the textual meaning. Entering them can be cumbersome, especially on mobile devices.</p>

<p>An accent-folding function is essentially a mapping of Unicode characters to their plain-ASCII equivalents. Anywhere you apply case-folding you should consider accent-folding, and for exactly the same reason. Then it doesn't matter whether the user searches for <b>cafe</b>, <b>café</b> or even <b>çåFé</b>, the software should do what they mean.</p>
 
<p><b>Be aware</b><b> there are a million caveats to accent rules. You will almost certainly get it wrong</b>. Almost every alphabet has a few extra-special marks that do affect meaning, and of course "non-Western" alphabets have completely different rules.</p>
    
    
<p>Another gotcha is the <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[:Block=Halfwidth_And_Fullwidth_Forms:]" rel="nofollow" style="COLOR:#551a8b">Unicode "fullwidth" Roman alphabet</a>. They are fixed-width versions of plain ASCII characters designed to line up with Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters, eg "１９７９年８月１５日". They reside in <code>0xff00</code> to <code>0xff5e</code> and should be treated as equivalent to their ASCII counterparts.</p>


<h4>Hey man, I'm only here for the copy/paste</h4>

<p>I've posted a more complete library on GitHub, but here's a basic version in Javascript:</p>
    
    
<blockquote><pre>
var accentMap = {
    'á':'a', 'é':'e', 'í':'i','ó':'o','ú':'u'
};

function accent_fold (s) {
    if (!s) { return ''; }
    var ret = '';
    for (var i=0; i&lt;s.length; i++) {
        ret += accent_map[s.charAt(i)] || s.charAt(i);
    }
    return ret;
};
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>Regular Expressions</h4>
    
<p>Regular expressions are very tricky to make accent-aware. Notice that in Fig. 1 only the unaccented entries are bolded. The problem is that the Unicode character layout does not lend itself to patterns that cut across languages. The proper regex for "<b>lo</b>" would be something insane like:</p>
    
<blockquote><pre>[LlĹĺĽľĻļḶḷḸḹḼḽḺḻŁłŁłĿŀȽƚɫ][OoÓóÒòŎŏÔôỐốỒồỖöȪȫŐőÕõṌȭȮȯǾǿ...ǬǭŌ]</pre></blockquote>
    
	<div style="TEXT-ALIGN:center">
      <i>Listing 1: ...now you have two problems.</i>
    </div>
    
<p>As of this writing, few regular expression engines support shortcuts for Unicode character classes. <a href="http://www.pcre.org/" rel="nofollow">PCRE</a> and Java seem to be in the vanguard. You probably shouldn't push it. Instead, try highlighting an accent-folded version of the string, and then use those character positions to highlight the original, like so:</p>
    
    
<blockquote><pre>
// accent_folded_hilite("Fulanilo López", 'lo')
//   --&gt; "Fulani&lt;b&gt;lo&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ló&lt;/b&gt;pez"
//
function accent_folded_hilite(str, q) {
  var str_folded = accent_fold(str).toLowerCase().replace(/[&lt;&gt;]+/g, '');
  var q_folded = accent_fold(q).toLowerCase().replace(/[&lt;&gt;]+/g, '');

  // create an intermediary string with hilite hints
  // example: fulani&lt;lo&gt; &lt;lo&gt;pez
  var re = new RegExp(q_folded, 'g');
  var hilite_hints = str_folded.replace(re, '&lt;'+q_folded+'&gt;');

  // index pointer for the original string
  var spos = 0;
  // accumulator for our final string
  var highlighted = '';

  // walk down the original string and the hilite hint
  // string in parallel. when you encounter a &lt; or &gt; hint,
  // append the opening / closing tag in our final string.
  // if the current char is not a hint, append the corresponding
  // char from the *original* string to our final string and
  // advance the original string's pointer.
  for (var i=0; i&lt;hilite_hints.length; i++) {
    var c = str.charAt(spos);
    var h = hilite_hints.charAt(i);
    if (h === '&lt;') {
       highlighted += '&lt;b&gt;';
    } else if (h === '&gt;') {
       highlighted += '&lt;/b&gt;';
    } else {
      spos += 1;
      highlighted += c;
    }
  }
  return highlighted;
}
</pre></blockquote>

  </div>
  <br>
  
<div style="TEXT-ALIGN:center">
    <i>Listing 2: a basic accent-insensitive string highlighter</i>
  </div>
  <br>
  
<p>Listing 2 is probably too simplistic for production code. You can't highlight multiple terms, for example. Some special characters might expand to two characters, like "<b>æ</b>" --&gt; "<b>ae</b>" which will screw up <code>spos</code>. It also strips out angle-brackets (&lt;&gt;) in the original string. But it's good enough for a first pass.</p>

<h4>Accent-folding in YUI Autocomplete</h4>

<p><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/autocomplete" id="zg:g" title="YUI's Autocomplete library">YUI's Autocomplete library</a> has many hooks and options to play with. Today we'll look at two overrideable methods: <code>filterResults()</code> and <code>formatMatch()</code>. <code>filterResults</code> lets you write your own matching function. formatMatch lets you change the HTML of an entry in the list of suggested matches.</b></p>

  

<blockquote><pre>
// our static address book
var addressBook = [
  {name:'Fulanito López', email:'fulanito@example.com'},
  {name:'Erik Lørgensen', email:'erik@example.com'},
  {name:'Lorena Smith',   email:'lorena@example.com'},
  {name:'James Lö',       email:'james@example.com'}
];

// add an accent-folded "search" field to each entry
for (var i=0; i&lt;addressBook.length; i++) {
  addressBook[i]['search'] = accent_fold(addressBook[i]['name']) +
      ' ' + addressBook[i]['email'];
}

var datasource = new YAHOO.util.LocalDataSource(addressBook);
datasource.responseSchema = {fields : ["email", "name", "search"]};
var autocomp = new YAHOO.widget.AutoComplete("toField", "ac", datasource);
autocomp.delimChar = [","," "];    // allow multiple entries

// iterate the entire datasource and search for q at the beginning
// of any words in the accent-folded "search" field
autocomp.filterResults = function(q, entries, resultObj, cb) {
    var matches = [];
    var re = new RegExp('\\b'+accent_fold(q), 'i');
    for (var i=0; i&lt;entries.length; i++) {
        if (re.test(entries[i]['search'])) {
            matches.push(entries[i]);
        }
    }
    resultObj.results = matches;
    return resultObj;
};

// create a pretty HTML representation of the match:
autocomp.formatResult = function (entry, q, match) {
    var name = accent_folded_hilite(entry[1], q);
    var email = accent_folded_hilite(entry[0], q);
    return name + ' &lt;' + email + '&gt;';
};

<h4>About those million caveats...</h4>


<p>This accent-folding trick works mostly for "Western European" text and not really all of it, eg, in German <b>Ü</b> probably should map to <b>Ue</b>. Accent folding exploits specific quirks of the the language family and the limited problem domains of our examples, where it's better to get more results than no results. A French person searching the web for <b>thé</b> (tea) would be upset to be flooded with irrelevant English text.</p>

<p>There's only so far you can push a simple character map. It would be very tricky to reconcile the Roman "<b>Marc Chagall</b>" with the Cyrillic "<b>Марк Шагал</b>" or Yiddish "<b>מאַרק שאַגאַל</b>". There are very interesting similarities in the characters but a magical context-free two-way mapping is probably not possible.</p>

<p>On top of all that there is another problem: one language can have more than one writing system. Transliteration is writing a language in a different alphabet. It's not quite the same as transcription, which maps <i>sounds</i> as in "<b>hola, que paso</b>" --&gt; "<b>oh-la, keh pah-so</b>". Transliterations try to map the <i>written symbols</i> to another alphabet, ideally in a way that's reversible.</p>

<p>These four sentences all say "Children like to watch television" in Japanese:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Kanji</b>: 子供はテレビを見るのが好きです。</li>
<li><b>Hiragana</b>: こども は てれび を みる の が すき です 。</li>
<li><b>Romaji</b>: kodomo wa terebi o miru noga suki desu.</li>
<li><b>Cyrillic</b>: кодомо ва тэрэби о миру нога суки дэсу.</li>
</ul>

<p>For centuries people have been inventing ways to write different languages with whatever keyboards or typesetting they had available. So even if the user reads only one language they might do so in multiple transliteration schemes. Some schemes are logical and academic, but often they are messy organic things that depend on regional accent and historical cruft. The computer era kicked off a new explosion of systems as people learned to chat and send emails in plain ASCII.</p>

<p>There is a lot of prior work on this problem and two ready paths you can choose: the right way and the maybe-good-enough way. Neither have the simplicity of our naïve hash table, but they will be less disappointing for your users in general applications.</p>

<p>The first is <a id="q2_j" href="http://icu-project.org" title="International Components for Unicode">International Components for Unicode</a> (ICU), a project that originated in the early nineties in the European Union. It aims to be a complete, language-aware transliteration, Unicode, formatting, everything library. It's big, it's C++/Java, and requires contextual knowledge of the inputs and outputs in order to work. </p>

<p>The second is <a id="oieg" href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Text::Unidecode" title="Unidecode">Unidecode</a>, a context-free transliteration library available for Perl and <a id="b2g5" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unidecode" title="Python">Python</a>. It tries to transliterate all Unicode characters to a basic Latin alphabet. It makes little attempt to be reversible, language-specific, or even generally correct; it's a quick-and-dirty hack that nonetheless is pretty comprehensive.</p>

<p>Accent-folding in the right places saves your users time and makes your software smarter. The strict segregation of languages and locales is partially an artifact of technology limitations which no longer hold. It's up to you how far you want to take things, but even a little bit of effort goes a long way. Good luck!</p>
